# Optimal-Pathfinding-in-Maze-using-Uniform-Search-and-A-Algorithm
In this project, we implemented Uniform Search and Maze Star (A*) Algorithms on a maze to find the optimal path from start to goal. The maze consists of walls and open paths. Uniform Search explores all paths by cost, while A* uses cost and heuristics for faster, efficient pathfinding.
